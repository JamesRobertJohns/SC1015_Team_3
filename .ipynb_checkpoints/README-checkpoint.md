# Multi-class Classification of Bird Species based on Birdsongs

## About the Project

This is a simple, exploratory project on attempting to do classifications of bird species by using birdsongs. The data set is the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/british-birdsong-dataset">British Birdsong dataset</a> taken from Kaggle. It has 264 samples from 88 unique bird species.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

We extracted features from the audio signals for visualisation.

## Metadata Analysis

The distribution of classes in the sample is balanced. With 3 members per class.
